## Applications
Here you can find all the optical setups we tested or proposed so far.

This is a growing list of available optical setups coming along with tutorials and alignment instructions. The most important part is the core building block as you can also find it in every modular toolbox. A detailed description of the the **UC2** cube can be found [here](../CAD/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base_v2/Readme.md).

## General Naming Convetion and Structure of UC2

## Confusion about version v0 vs. version v2

We made a change in the CAD design of the cube in order to be more generic (e.g. point symmetry around the center). We're trying hard to update the APPlications so that everything is based on the new design, but it's a lot of files and there are probably still some forgotten v0 parts.

If you're unsure, check out the [Modular Developer Kit](../MDK) - there you find a general definition of the shape and size of the inserts which is up to date!

The outer cube dimensions stayed the same, but the inserts changed completely!

If you have a cool idea, please don't hesitate to contact us, we are happy to incorporate it in our design to make it even better.  
More setups are coming soon!
Inspire us with your ideas - we try to make it work! :-)
