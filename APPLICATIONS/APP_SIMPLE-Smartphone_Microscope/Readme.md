# Simple Smartphone Microscope

This is the repository for the simple version of the [Smartphone Microscope](../APP_SMARTPHONE_MICROSCOPE).

There is a [mechanical only version](./mechanical) and a [version with electronics](./electronic), but without the need of Raspberry Pi or the android app, as compared to the full version of this microscope.

</p>

It's based on a compound microscope which itself relies on finite corrected objective lenses. The Smartphone reimages the image of the eyepiece onto the camera sensor. This means that the smartphone's camera lens acts like the eye. Proper imaging is achieved if the exit pupil of the eyepiece is matching well with the entrance pupil of the smartphone camera.

</p>

The optical path is composed of two main elements - microscope objective and an eyepiece. The finite corrected objective (MO) lens produces an intermediate image in its tube-length (160 mm). This image is propagated to infinity by the eyepiece (EP). The smartphone (CAM) focusses this image on the smartphone's camera sensor. The mirrors (M) are just folding the beam. In the electronic version, the LED-Array (LA) is giving the option of different illumination intensity.
