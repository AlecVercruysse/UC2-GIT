## BASE CUBE - 3D printing files
The `.stl`-files can directly be printed using off-the-shelf 3D printer. 

An archive with all the files can be found [here](BASECUBE_v2.zip).


## Parts

### 3D printing parts 
The Part consists of the following components. 

* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([Cube-LID](BASE_CUBE_v2_10_Cube_Lid.stl))
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([Cube-BASE](BASE_CUBE_v2_10_Cube_Base.stl))
* **The Skeleton** which holds the magnets and is the back-bone of the UC2-system holding electronics etc. ([Sekelton](BASE_CUBE_v2_00_Base_v0.stl))

### Additional parts 
* 4x DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel!)
* 4x Neodym Ballmagnets 5mm diameter


## 3D Printing

We rely on the ***Ultimaker 2+*** and  ***Prusa i3 Mk3*** which uses Cura as a slicing software. Please see [Printing](/PRINTER)-section for more details about the printing.
