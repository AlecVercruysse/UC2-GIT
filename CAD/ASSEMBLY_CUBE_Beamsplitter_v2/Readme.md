# Beamsplitter Cube
This is the repository for the Beamsplitter Cube.

The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).

### Purpose
It adapts a beamsplitter cube to the UC2 system.

## Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube

## Parts

### 3D printing parts
The Part consists of the following components.

* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID](./STL/Assembly_Cube_Beamsplitter_10_Lid_1x1_v2.stl))
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE](./STL/Assembly_Cube_Beamsplitter_10_Cube_1x1_v2.stl))
* **The Beamsplitter Insert** which holds a glass beamsplitter cube and adapts it to the base cube ([Beamsplitter](./STL/Assembly_Cube_Beamsplitter_20_Cube_Insert_Beamsplitter.stl))

### Additional parts
* 4x DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel)
* 1x Beamsplitter cube (20×20 mm²)


## Remarks and Tips
### 3D Printing:
* No support required in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

## Assembly
* Remove any support and clean the part
* Insert the glass beamsplitter inside its holder
* Slide the beamsplitter holder into the Cube Body
* Add the lid and fix it using a set of M3 screws
* Done!

## Safety
Don't touch the smooth glass surfaces, only the opaque ones!

Never (!) look into the laser pointer! It will damage your eye immediately!

* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LASER! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTEDED USE
* BEAM HAS TO GO AWAY FROM ONESELF - ALWAYS!
