# Kinematic Mirror Holder Cube
This is the repository for the Kinematic Mirror Holder Cube.

The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).

### Purpose
It adapts a mirror to the UC2 system. It allows precise tilting in *x* and *y*.

## Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube

## Parts

### 3D printing parts
The Part consists of the following components.

* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Mirror_Kinematic_v2_10_Lid_1x1_v2_2.stl))
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Mirror_Kinematic_v2_10_Cube_1x1_v2_1.stl))
* **The Kinematic Mirror Holder** which holds a Mirror and adapts it to the base cube ([MIRROR HOLDER](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Mirror_Kinematic_v2_20_Cube_Insert_Kinematic_Mirrormount_base.stl))

### Additional parts
* 7× DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel)
* 3× Ballmagnets, arbitrary diameter
* Metalplate, 30×40 mm<sup>2</sup>, magnetic material
* 1× Mirror



## Remarks and Tips
### 3D Printing:
* No support required in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

## Assembly
* Remove any support and clean the part
* Insert three M3 screw into the holes in the mirror holder. There are four holes - the one in the center of the part stays empty! Make sure you are using the correct holes
* Slide the mirror holder into the Cube
* Add the lid and fix it using a set of M3 screws
* Glue your mirror to the metal Metalplate. Place the mirror roughly in the center of the plate
* Attach the Metalplate, which carries the mirror, to the ends of the screws of the Mirror holder using the magnets
* Done!

## Safety
Don't touch the mirror surface!

When working with lasers:  

Never (!) look into the laser pointer! It will damage your eye immediately!


* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LASER! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTEDED USE
* BEAM HAS TO GO AWAY FROM ONESELF - ALWAYS!
