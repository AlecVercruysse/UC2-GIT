# Generic Lensholder Cube
This is the repository for the Generic Lensholder Cube.

The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).

### Purpose
It adapts any circular symmetric lens with varying diameter to the UC2 system.

![](./IMAGES/Assembly_Cube_Objectiveholder.png)


### Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube
* the adapter can hold a large variety of different lenses (differnt diameters/threads)
* the spiral automatically centers the lens to the optical axis
* the here used objective lens has the following parameters:
	* Thread: RMS
	* Magnification: 4x
	* NA: 0.1
	* Finite Corrected Optics



## Parts

### 3D printing parts
The Part consists of the following components.

* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place
* **The Objective/Lens Holder** which holds a lens with varying diamater and adapts it to the base cube

### Additional parts
* 8x DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel)
* Microscopic Objective lens, 4x, 0.1NA, RMS-Thread, Finite corrected or any lens < 16mm Diameter


## Remarks and Tips
### 3D Printing:
* No support required in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

## Assembly
* Mount the lens inside the insert
* Put the Insert inside the Cube
* Add all screws to the Cube
* Done!

## Safety
Attention, don't cut your fingers while removing the lens from the iPhone sensor!

Never (!) look into the laser pointer! It will damage your eye immediately!


* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LASER! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTEDED USE
* BEAM HAS TO GO AWAY FROM ONESELF - ALWAYS!
