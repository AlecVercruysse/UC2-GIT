## Parts

### <img src="./IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
Here we list the 3D printed components from the ./STL folder


The Part consists of the following components.

1. **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID](./STL/10_Lid_1x1_v2.stl))
2. **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE](./STL/10_Cube_1x1_v2.stl))
3. **The Smartphone holder**, on which the phone will be placed ([SMARTPHONE](./STL/30_Smartphone_Holder.stl))

## Remarks and Tips

### 3D Printing
Settins for cura? Support? Temperture?

### Tricks
Anything which need to get mentioned here?

## <img src="./IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Remove any support and clean the part
* Add the lid and fix it using a set of M3 screws
* Fix the holder on the side of the cube opposite to the lid using four M3 screws
