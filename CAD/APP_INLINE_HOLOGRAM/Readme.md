## Inline Holographic Microscope
This is the repository for the inline hographical microscope. This will be part of the workshop which can be found in WORKSHOP.

It acquires the interference of the spherial wave coming from a pinhole, illuminated by an LED, and the scattered wave from a transparent (phase) sample.

For reconstructing the Hologram, acquired on-chip (Raspi-Cam, left) one only needs to "deconvolve" it with the free propagator at a certain z-distance (i.e. fresnel propagator).

A more in-detail documentation can be found [here](./../../WORKSHOP/INLINE-HOLOGRAMM)
