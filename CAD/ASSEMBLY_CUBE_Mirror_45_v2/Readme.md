# Adjustable Mirror Holder Cube
This is the repository for the Adjustable Mirror Holder Cube.

The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).

### Purpose
It adapts a 1 inch fold-mirror to the UC2 system.

Due to limited space, we need to fold the beam using a mirror. This is done by reflecting the incoming light under an angle of 45°. It follows in a change of the optical axis by 90°


## Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube
* the adapter holds a 1 inch circular mirror (e.g. Thorlabs part) at 45 degrees in a UC2 base cube
* the angle of the mirror can be varied in a limited range (e.g. +/- 5°-10°) using a flexure bearing driven by a screw and nut + spring to aply pre-force
* the here used mirror has the following parameters:
	* Diameter: 25,4mm
	* Reflectance
	* Surface Flatness: (Peak to Valley) λ/10 @ 633 nm
	* Substrate Fused: Silica
	* Thickness: 6.0 mm (0.24")




## Parts

### 3D printing parts
The Part consists of the following components.

* **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place
* **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place
* **The Mirror Insert** which holds a 1 inch Mirror from Thorlabs or a 30x30mm Mirror from Amazon and adapts it to the base cube

### Additional parts
* 8x DIN912 M3*12 screws (non stainless steel)
* 1x Thorlabs PF10-03-P01 - Protected Silver Mirror or
* 1x 30x30 Mirror from Amazon  

## Remarks and Tips
### 3D Printing:
* No support required in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

## Assembly
* Add the mirror to the Insert
* Add the insert to the Cube
* Add the screws to the Cube
* Done!

## Safety
Don't touch the silver surface!

Attention, don't cut your fingers while removing the lens from the iPhone sensor!

Never (!) look into the laser pointer! It will damage your eye immediately!


* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LASER! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTEDED USE
* BEAM HAS TO GO AWAY FROM ONESELF - ALWAYS!
